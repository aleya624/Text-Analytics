Shanell Madrid,2026-02-28T00:46:09.000Z,"Everything was quick and easy, something I didn’t understand about coverage and Jalol explained everything efficiently. Provided me with a roomier car. "
Amanda Portillo,2026-02-27T04:45:06.000Z,Booked through Priceline and the final cost was much higher due to multiple add-ons that were not clearly explained at pickup. I declined insurance but was still charged because I didn’t provide a declarations page — something that wasn’t communicated at the counter.It was impossible to get a clear combined breakdown of what I prepaid vs. what ACE charged. Make sure you review every line before signing.
JaeDanae,2026-02-26T17:58:11.000Z,"They don’t contact you with any information after your booking then at the last minute inform you of policies you need to get the car. When you can’t meet the criteria because they did not inform you before hand, they won’t give you the car and then won’t refund your money. I’ll never use them again. Very scammy and complete waste of my time and money. Go with someone more reputable "
Ln,2026-02-24T23:34:28.000Z,"Was charged for a tiny chip in the low black corner windshield  section of our Kia soul rental. Pretty sure this was preexisting as we were cleared initially  and then Marco took out his flashlight after we walked away and starts yelling at us to come back. The tiny chip was very hard to see unless you shined a flashlight directly on it… those rental lots are very dark - probably  on purpose. We drove the car less than 100 miles. Ace is charging our Insurance over $2000 to fix. And will not provide us a final repair invoice or proof it was even repaired. Probably not repairing it and going to pull the same scam. They also have you sign the sheet to mark down nicks as you are leaving and just say “sign here” . We didn’t realize it was the sheet to mark down nicks,etc…  until it was too late. This is so completely scammy if you ask me…do not rent from ACE ever…."
-Minute man-,2026-02-24T19:36:17.000Z,"Location: Wrocław airport.Total scam. When I returned the car, they said everything was fine and I’d get my refund the next day. I called several times and they kept promising the money was coming. Then, out of nowhere, they messaged me claiming I damaged the car and demanding over €1,000! Unbelievable and dishonest. Avoid them at all costs."
Norbert Doerr,2026-02-23T23:47:50.000Z,"DONT BOOK WITH ACE RENT A CAR!!! SCAM ALERT!!!They scam their customers by forcing them to buy additional insurance they don’t need. First of all there is a shortage of rental cars on Maui. So I already paid a fortune to rent a car. Mine was $ 787.00 for a compact, 5 days. And on top of it they added „Collision“ for $ 167.00 so the my grand total was $ 954.00.So here is the story. When I arrived there was nobody behind the counter and I was told to check in with a “virtual agent”. I walked over to the screen and talked to an agent via live chat – Wow, what an experience. He asked me if I have coverage for rental cars with my insurance. I said yes and he demanded that I have to show proof. I took a screenshot of my ID car where it shows: Damage to rental cars is covered. So now he is demanding proof, that I have “Collision” on my policy. I am getting excited, stopped the conversation and called Progressive. I talked to an agent and they send me a copy of verification of my policy. BTW Progressive was absolutely helpful in this situation, I give them 5 stars. However, in the meanwhile a real person (Ms. Ann Purity) was available behind the counter and I showed her the document on my phone. She insisted that I need to have “Collision”. I never had an argument like that when I picked up a rental car, so I asked her, why do I need this coverage when my insurance covers rental cars? So she is getting upset and aggressive with me, tells me that I don´t get the car when I have no coverage for “Collision” on my policy. With other words, she is threatening me - if I don´t buy the extra insurance - I don´t get my car. It was a very bad experience dealing with this agent because she used the leverage, no insurance no car. So what can I do? Nothing, because I need a car for my vacation. So I paid for this ridiculous scam $ 167.00. And what did I get? An old damaged and dirty Nissan Sentra.                Yes, they had one of the lowest prices online and that’s how they lure you in. And screw their customers while they have no alternative. This situation was extremely frustrating, especially when you on vacation. So do yourself a favor and go to a rental car agency with a good reputation."
Lukasz Pruszynski,2026-02-21T20:59:00.000Z,"Fast and nice service, brand new car rented for 8 days. Quick and trouble-free return, deposit unlocked within a few hours. ACE Wroclaw - I recommend"
Nathan,2026-02-17T23:00:10.000Z,"Was given a price on rental car through price line. Went to the agent and he said, "" you can't rent a car, snow storm in the forecast. Colorado law requires chains and you will get fined for not having chains. You must upgrade to a SUV. "". He pointed to a big sign on the wall. Then it was the insurance.. ""you have to have insurance"". I asked wasn't that in our original price? "" No you have to pay more coverage , what you paid isn't enough""... I just bit my tongue, initialed all the agreements, put in my credit card and silently seethed my way out to the vehicle.  "
Daniel,2026-02-16T21:01:20.000Z,"DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY. This is not just a case of poor service; it is a systematic scam designed to drain your bank account through fraudulent damage claims and a confusing web of shell companies.The Scheme:1. Identity Confusion: We booked through ACE, but upon arrival, the office operated under a completely different name.2. The ""Ghost"" Charge: A third, unrelated company handles the security deposit. They reserve a large sum 5600 PLN about 1500 EUR, which is then automatically deducted without your consent.3. Fake Damage Reports: Shortly after returning the car, a fourth company sends a fabricated damage report, referencing an obscure insurance provider to give the scam a veneer of legitimacy.4. Zero Accountability: Once they have your money, their customer service goes completely silent. They do not answer emails, calls, or disputes.Final Verdict:They rely on the complexity of multiple company names to make it impossible for you to track down who is responsible. It is a calculated trap. Save yourself the stress and the money—book with a reputable, transparent agency instead."

Wasif Hussain,2026-02-10T14:56:53.000Z,"Outrageous! 1800 euro stolen by Ace Rent a carcar hire on 24/12/25, not told 1800 euro deposit would be taken from account, but taken. Car returned fine, have pictures and confirmation. Now 10th Feb 2026, still no 1800 Euro deposit back and company often don't reply, they have said 'it will be paid back next week three times'. I have given deadline which they have ignored. Wrong pickup location details at Naples Airport, late driver arrival, very far off-site and many other problems. 3 hours of time lost, and now I have to fly to Italy and report to police. Fraud reported to bankWorst by far of all the past 30 car hires I have done in Europe in the last ten years"
Luigi De Marco,2026-02-10T13:36:39.000Z,"When I picked it up at the Capodichino airport in Naples, the company delivered a completely dirty and dented car. When I asked for a change, they told me they couldn't because the offices were closed. They told me to come back two days later for the change, but when I arrived, they told me they couldn't because the car was in working order despite the damage all over the bodywork, and the bumper was broken and not fully secured. What's more serious is that they took 1800 euros but not as a deposit or earnest money, they actually kept it and they will return it to me after 30 working days!!!!"
Ben,2026-02-10T07:02:06.000Z,"Terrible car rental company. I returned the car after several days of use, and the staff pointed out a tiny micro-scratch on the windshield as an excuse to keep my €900 deposit. Completely unacceptable and feels like a scam. I strongly recommend avoiding this company unless you want to lose your time and money."

Jana,2026-02-04T23:26:59.000Z,"My experience with ACE Rent A Car was extremely disappointing and felt like a complete rip off. They charged and withheld my full deposit of 3,500 PLN for a microscopic stone chip on the windscreen of about 1×1 mm with no cracks or structural damage. This clearly falls under normal wear and tear.What makes this even worse is that video from 27 January, the day I had the vehicle, already shows this chip, which I documented with screenshot. Keeping a full deposit for pre existing, normal wear and tear is completely unacceptable.Sent few emails to customer service - NO RESPONSEJUST AVOID THEM .. SCAMMERS."
Lukasz Jaromin,2026-02-03T20:46:26.000Z,"Avoid renting from this company, particularly at Katowice Airport, Poland. After returning the vehicle, I was charged 4,500 PLN from my security deposit for alleged minor cosmetic marks. No proper evidence of an actual repair was provided, as the funds were deducted from my credit card the same day—without a VAT invoice or an independent assessment, only an internal estimate. Fabricated images of a scratched clock dashboard were presented, and despite my immediate dispute and formal written notice, the company refused any refund. After numerous calls, I finally managed to reach them, but the representatives were uncooperative and refused to provide any sensible information. They claimed that I have my own insurance, so I would be reimbursed anyway. This situation is highly suspicious and should be avoided. Huge Scammers ! ! !"
Ty,2026-02-03T20:34:43.000Z,"Crooked. When we were driving our rental on the highway in Florida, a rock was shot from the car ahead and left a small knick in the windshield. Nothing was said upon returning the car by staff. When we got home, they sent us an over $2000 usd bill to replace the whole windshield. Absolutely ridiculous to replace the whole windshield for something that minor. A bunch of scam artists "
Shirley Sypien,2026-02-03T05:00:11.000Z,Scammers!  Do not rent from them
Alice,2026-02-03T18:53:13.000Z,"Rental Nightmare! Rental quote of $231 ended up $401 with tons of hidden fees! Took 2 hours from airport to leaving with the car, which was smaller than requested and had stained upholstery. We found personal items (tobacco) in glove box from previous rental! UPDATE: Ace Rent a Car responded and asked me to contact them, but the email address they provided is not a valid email so my message gets returned to me. Do they really care about my comments?"
Al Dinello,2026-02-02T04:44:21.000Z,I don't know where to start. We had to take 2 shuttles to get to the rental car. Then when we sign for the vehicle they force you to buy their insurance. I explained I've rented plenty of cars without added insurance but the agent would'nt budge. Then when we return the vehicle they add another $30.00. For a grand total of an extra $240.00 for the 4 day rental. After I got home and checked the reviews I saw how bad this company is rated and I can see why. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from Ace Car Rental.. Trust me
John Johnson,2026-01-31T20:54:51.000Z,King is the best. His customer service is phenomenal. Always takes care of us.Thanks again
CHARLES SPEN,2026-01-31T18:49:07.000Z,"Bait and Switch They will claim they can't fine your reservation and will not even look at your email confirmation form Expedia and the price will be 5 x higher and they will force you to pay$50/day for insurance,  This company can't come with Budget Rental so they just run a bait and switch .   If the offer is too good to be true, run.   This place is a Scam Shop  "
Rachel,2026-01-30T17:36:46.000Z,From the pick up at the airport I was greeted by Fitzum. Professional and polite. Fitzum helped me load and unload my suitcase. I was greeted by Lulia inside and she was a warm friendly face. No issues with car rental. This was a great way to start off my visit to see my US Air Force Academy Cadet.
Aron hhh,2026-01-30T03:38:44.000Z,I paid in Hotwire $55 for 2 days but I got charged for 3 days. Claiming a 3 day minimum charge.Pressure for buying insurance!The guy wanted me to proof him @ midnight that my CC provides incurance.Got a car without a working infotainment system had to change the car @ midnight.When I called the service call centre 3 times every one told me something else not knowing a thing. 
Sy,2026-01-30T00:58:13.000Z,"Big problem at the final billing. I had prepaid $532, which they received (verified by them)  the total bill including all extras was $572, but the company charged an additional $131, instead of $40. I was told that no matter the actual money received in prepayment, it was only credited as whatever they charge for basic rental, in this case $441. So I paid them $532, but they were only giving me $441 toward my final bill. Despite the nonsense of this, they refused to budge, and I was forced into the long paperwork process of disputing the overcharge. My guess is they do this all the time, so if you rent from them make sure when you drop off, you're credited for your full pre-payment."
Kévin Obch,2026-01-28T21:16:24.000Z,"Extremely disappointing experience with OSEK RENT A CAR / ACE.After returning the vehicle, I was charged 2,586 PLN from my security deposit for alleged minor cosmetic marks. No proper evidence of an actual repair was provided — no VAT invoice, no independent assessment — only an internal estimate.Despite immediate dispute and a formal written notice, the company refused any refund.The situation was resolved only after initiating a bank chargeback, which resulted in a full refund.This kind of deposit handling creates unnecessary stress and raises serious concerns about transparency and fairness.If you rent here, protect yourself:Take extensive photos/videos at pick-up and returnKeep all documentationBe prepared to challenge unjustified charges through your bankI would not recommend this company based on my experience."
Julie Luthy,2026-01-28T01:40:48.000Z,"Don't rent from them!!!  they assured me I had a vehicle.  I called the day before arriving on Maui to once again check.   I was assured yet again, they had my car.  Then waited at the airport for the shuttle only to be told that they didn't have a car for me.  Don't do it."
Vic Tobar,2026-01-27T18:27:28.000Z,"Horrible service, waited over 1 hr to be picked up and they keep saying 10 minutes, DO NOT hire this company"
Sarah E,2026-01-22T15:50:22.000Z,Do not trust this company. They hide many hidden fees in their general contract that you sign to rent the car. Our own car insurance pays for all incidents in rental cars as most of your do as well! Ace hides rental insurance in their paperwork that you sign and charges you for it. Go with the larger more reputable company!  Complained to their manager about this and his answer was basically touch luck to us.
Jason Chesler,2026-01-22T02:47:06.000Z,Reinna and the whole ace team were amazing!! Facility and car was clean and easy to find from airport shuttle

Jim Vann,2026-01-20T18:08:18.000Z,This company did not honor the car rental agreement. They attempted to collect additional feesby claiming the reserved car was not available stating a $100/day fee was required for an upgrade to available car.  I received assistance from the travel agent who handled the reservation.  They offered a car from another renter at the same original price.
Michelle Bryant,2026-01-20T12:52:13.000Z,The agent kept trying to upgrade me into a more expensive car when I just needed the the small car. She also stated there is no smoking in the car. I told her I had asthma and that I didnt smoke. When I received the car it was clear that someone smoked in it. Takes forever to get your deposit back if you do at all. 
Chartia Faniel,2026-01-20T00:22:24.000Z,Clint was pleasant and helpful 
Christopher Baudo,2026-01-19T17:41:35.000Z,"I used Booking.com to reserve a compact car and when I got to the counter, the agent told me that I needed to pay for an upgrade because vehicle that I selected was not available. So I ask why I would have to pay for an upgrade if Ace doesn't have the vehicle that I reserved and was told that I could wait for one to arrive!!! They are prepared to set you up before you arrive in Fort Lauderdale so beware. "

customer,2026-01-18T17:34:04.000Z,"We rented a car from ACE Rent a Car from Fort Lauderdale for one week. We reserve the car on Expedia with guaranteed price. We bought our own SunPass for toll roads in Florida which works perfectly for previous rentals. The ACE front desk told us that our SunPass will not work for their vehicles. He said we need to pay $69 in addition for ""unlimited toll use,"" or we will be heavily penalized if we cross toll roads by accident. Then he said, ""Sometimes the SunPass works"" on their rental car. We struggle for 20 minutes and couldn't register their rental car based on all correct information. I believe it's a hidden scheme for ACE to make extra money. There is no way we can rev up $69 in toll as we are only visiting the Everglades and Key West. Please ask around: ACE needs to be transparent with their ""required SunPass toll fee"" upfront in their website. If we knew they charge extra, we would have rented from Hertz which allows use of our own SunPass (I asked their front desk upon leaving) and is equally priced or cheaper after the added fee.  "
michal friedman,2026-01-18T12:15:27.000Z,"Unprofessional and misleading rental experience – not recommendedWe booked and paid online for a Nissan Qashqai (or similar) with full AXA insurance, suitable for a family of five.At pickup, we were pressured to buy additional insurance despite already having full coverage.Instead of the booked vehicle, we were given a Toyota Yaris, clearly not comparable in size. After walking in the snow with children and luggage, it became obvious the car was unsuitable and unsafe.Only after requesting cancellation did a Toyota RAV4 suddenly become available, with an extra charge demanded.The replacement car was handed over in the dark, without inspection or documentation.At return, no inspection was done, yet days later we received damage claims for issues that did not occur, and the deposit was blocked for an excessive period.Overall, this felt like a systematic lack of transparency and pressure-based conduct.We do not recommend renting from ACE, especially at Warsaw Chopin Airport."

I did not realize she had added additional Insurance until I seen it posted to my Credit Card. Review your Rental Agreement before signing. They are professionals at scamming money out of their customers. Also, there will be miscellaneous Charges on your final Bill. Some I have never heard of.

CGV,2026-01-11T12:29:50.000Z,"ACE Rental Cars, Cancún / MexicoIt is strongly discouraged to do business with this so-called rental agency. On arrival, they will have you waiting for hours at the airport, making repeated phone calls until they finally show up and take you to a makeshift office. Then they will try to upsell you an additional liability insurance, even if you present a complete insurance coverage certificate. This will double up your total rental cost and boost their earnings. Then they will make you believe that there are not sufficient funds on your credit card for the deposit, but if you buy another insurance from them, they could lower the amount. Don't fall for their tricks, they are crooks!"

"Wow, this is...",2026-01-13T18:02:13.000Z,"Great start to a vacay.  After waiting for an hour and a half at the Cancun airport, the rental company Sixt car rental helped me call ACE.  Initially they said would take them another 50 minutes to retrieve me at 2 kilometers away. Eventually, I and another family arrived at the ACE/Movii car rental place. I had already paid for the car rental upfront on Wisecars for a full 12 days in Cancun MX which included CDW & TP insurance.  When I arrived Ace (aka Movii) wanted a $400 USD ransome for what they claimed was insurance on the car in Cancun.  This was about identical to the base rate I'd already paid beforehand for the car in the US.  There was an extended ""discussion"", but of course I needed the car to get to Carmen and it was already dark outside.  ACE/Movii simply wouldn't let me take the car without paying this ransome amount and a $1000 deposit (the family before me paid some amount more than that).ACE/Movii isn't listed on Googlemaps in the correct location, making it another outrageous event finding the place on the way back.  Now, you know why.To their note: they already have been alerted about all of this and hopefully my credit card will resolve the ransome in my favor. "

Harry Alexander,2026-01-07T00:53:50.000Z,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT ever in your life rent a car from Ace Rental especially at the Atlanta airport. The company has poor customer service hidden fees and most of all running a complete scam. I was charge $1243.32 for traveling out of the region in which I knew nothing of or was informed of a regional travel policy during my booking at the rental counter. Customer Care and the Rental agents are a total joke. I have reasoned with them explaining I was never informed or aware of the travel policy. Customer Care and the Rental agent at the Atlanta Airport states their policy No Refund No Waiver. It appears customer care and the rental agents are receiving bonus incentives on those customers who was excessively penalized. Not only was I penalized for $1000.00 the greedy scammers had the nerve to tax me on the penalty which increases the fine. I had asked if I can get the additional tax refunded and was told by Gina a big NO.. Customer Care and the Rental agents identical  telemarketing scripts responses are nonchalant, unconcerned most of all unbothered. Both Customer Care and The Rental agents are heavy on the policy No REFUND NO WAIVER end of discussion.As logical or reasonable I'd attempted to explain at no time customer care not even pretend to resolve the situation. Why would I even attempt to take the risk traveling outside the region when every rental car has a tracker. This scamming company is not trying to compromise or refund my money therefore I have to get legal representation to fight against these scamming Bullies. The more poor reviews will definitely help the customer in court. Even AI gives a low grade horrible report against this scamming company."

I was told that the 2026 Kick they gave me was an upgrade.  WHAT??? The body style is slightly different, but definitely not an upgrade.  $154 extra for the same car.

Yvonne,2026-01-04T20:42:15.000Z,"2.5 stars because car was good and reliable. But otherwise a very poor customer experience. First, they needed proof of my auto insurance when I arrived to pick up, but hadn't said so ahead of time. I didn't happen to have the latest with me and had to get on line to my co. to show the proof. (I later rented from Hertz in same place and was never asked this.) The clerk I was dealing with --at a screen in their pick-up office, not in-person-- was very machinistic, unhelpful and impersonal. Clerks in the room were probably overworked, but they were also very impersonal. (Very poor customer service.) The customers after me had the same difficulties and went elsewhere rather than resolving it there. When I needed to extend the rental due to illness that made me unable to fly, they charged an extra $20/day for each day it was extended - thus doubling the original price. A one-time fee would be understandable, but each day?! When I later rented from Hertz for a few days, and then also had to extend that car, there was no fee for extending; in fact, the price went down because they automatically changed me to the better weekly rate... and Hertz' customer service was very pleasant and helpful.However, the car at Ace was new, good, clean and reliable. I was completely happy with the car. But I would never do business with this company again if I could in any way avoid it."

Jm,2025-12-31T02:37:29.000Z,"I chose Ace for a week-long rental because they had the cheapest rates in Manchester. When I returned the car I found out why. After seven days' incident-free driving, they spotted three tiny dents to the bodywork and a scratch to the rear bumper. By 'tiny',  I mean barely visible (at least not to me when I took the car out!). When they forwarded me the photos, they added a helpful 'zebra' effect to make things clearer - along with an invoice for just south of £1,000. Luckily my insurers picked up the tab, but it was a lesson learnt. I'm not saying don't hire from these guys - just be aware of their business model, inspect every inch of the car and have your insurer on speed dial."

Davante Longley,2025-12-28T01:20:29.000Z,I highly recommend you do not rent a car from these people now I understand why people don’t choose this I literally spent over $2000 for a van that has scratches and the car doesn’t even come with a spare tire..I was literally on the side of the road for over 5 hours waiting for assistance 
Bonevox,2025-12-27T15:29:23.000Z,"An absolute rip off - very rude and horrible service and deliberately trying to overcharge. . Both to us and to another couple renting a car, not to mention an elderly gentleman who got abused. Do not use for any reason.  (Apparently changed name from “Target” to “Ace”)"
MF,2025-12-27T09:10:18.000Z,"I rented a car from October 29 - November 5.It is December 26 today, and I just received an email from them that they charged my card for $77 USD for parking violation. $50 of the $77 is admin fee!This is unacceptable. I expect a full refund!"
carol chapin,2025-12-24T23:38:43.000Z,"DO NOT USE ACE RENTAL CARSFormal complaint ACE RENTAL CARSSubject: Complaint – Unsafe Vehicle & Unauthorized SLI Charge – ACE Rental Car at FLLIssues with the vehicle:I was given a car with a non‑functional horn.(safety issue)The Bluetooth in the vehicle did not work.These issues affected both safety (no horn) and basic functionality (no Bluetooth), and the car should not have been on the road in that condition.Unauthorized SLI charge:At the counter, I was offered Supplemental Liability Insurance (SLI).I clearly refused SLI multiple times (at least five times).I was bullied by the agent how i needed it even after refusal (i'm sure they get commision for all add ons)Despite this, SLI was added to my rental and I was charged for it.I am disputing this SLI charge as unauthorized and contrary to my explicit refusal.Customer care experience:I called customer care to resolve the issue and was told more time was needed to “refute” the charge. that he had to contact that location and wait for an unspecified time for their response and or refusal.I had already waited two days just to reach someone by phone.chat service and phone service gave two different Reponses for why the charge was there and unable to be disputed. Shady practice.When I asked to speak with a manager/supervisor, my request for escalation was refused. and they hung up and had the audacity to ask for a review of the service call.This is unacceptable, especially given that the underlying issue is an unsafe vehicle and an insurance product I did not consent to purchase."
RT,2025-12-22T19:21:46.000Z,"Matt was great and helped make our experience better. He had a great attitude and listened throughout the whole process. Only feedback, I wish the pickup shuttles ran more frequently."
JJ,2025-12-21T07:21:55.000Z,"I will not rent from this company again and would not recommend it to family or friends. Employee strongly recommended an AWD vehicle due to “heavy snow” and a toll pass due to “heavy traffic.” Neither condition occurred during my trip. Additionally, he failed to disclose the cost of these add-ons unless I specifically asked. This was a deceptive and unprofessional experience."
Alec Dagg,2025-12-19T10:19:53.000Z,Awesome process. The guy who checked us in was great and even got us an upgrade! 
Chari Beyler,2025-12-18T17:50:22.000Z,"We rented a car while visiting CO November 25-29, 2025.Brenda was the rep that helped us, and she was SO professional and personable. She gave us added information about the area and was exceptionally helpful. You have a real asset in her as an employee!"
Rival Metal,2025-12-17T10:11:16.000Z,"Fraudulent Damage Claims & Lack of Transparency - Avoid!I had a terrible experience with ACERENTACAR (operated by OSEK RENT A CAR) in Poznan. I returned the car on December 2nd at 16:00 in perfect condition.However the company later charged me for a 'damaged plastic element' using a photo dated ONE DAY AFTER my return.Despite my formal requests they refused to provide an itemized repair invoice or an official return inspection report.When I challenged the claim, their 'customer care' LOGAN and DAVE supervisor simply stated their position wouldn't change without offering any evidence. This is a clear case of unauthorized and undocumented charging.Check the recent reviews before renting; it seems I am not the only victim of these suspicious tactics in Poznan.I have initiated a legal chargeback process through my bank.Renters, beware!"""
Karuo,2025-12-15T02:25:45.000Z,"Decent value if you lower your expectations. The car had high mileage but ran fine. Be aware of the large security deposit hold on your credit card, which can take weeks to release. Thoroughly inspect the vehicle for scratches before driving off to avoid unfair charges."
Chrystal Chrystal,2025-12-12T20:43:24.000Z,"Very poor customer service I got into an accident on Oct 27, 2025 someone hit me from behind while driving on the highway The police was called and  the rental car company inform of the accident, they let me know that this will be taken care of once I return the vehicle.I returned the vehicle and gave them the incident report from the police of the accident. It's now December a month and a half later I've been trying to call them to find out what was going on with the accident I've been calling every day since November I took out the insurance on the vehicle through Ace rental and they also charged me an extra $158 because of the accident even though I purchased the insurance. I spoke with several people concerning this matter, customer service at 1877-822-3872 and 1844-874-3966 which they said was the corporate office I spoke to a Dave C., a Jordan and I also spoke with the manager lucky at the Miami airport location with no resolution at all they gave me a number that was supposed to be to the claims department the first number they gave me was 361-450-1926 you couldn't even leave a message at this number the voicemail said leave a message, however the mailbox is full so you can't leave a message. it's been full for a month and a half, so I call back and  was given  a different phone number 210-403-2336 and I left numerous  messages on this answer machine and noone has yet to get back to me. I fill like I'm on a hamster wheel just going in circles. Im still waiting on a call or an email"
Ruthann Monterosa,2025-12-12T20:26:04.000Z,"We had a reservation at Ace Rent-A-Car that was booked through Priceline.  We went to pick up the car at Newark International Airport, and the young woman representative refused to rent the car to my husband as he didn't have our insurance information.  I was waiting outside, and I went back inside to tell the representative that I had the insurance information on my phone.  The employee who refused to rent the car to my husband had left, and a young man was at the desk.  When I explained that I had the insurance information on my phone, he told me that the reservation had already been cancelled. He told me there would be no charge.  A few weeks later, the charge appeared on my credit card.   I was unsuccessful in reaching Priceline to speak to anyone.  When the phone prompted me to use my reservation number, the response was that there was no reservation with that number. I had spent many hours trying to call Ace and Priceline, and finally I decided to dispute the charge with my credit card company.  Now they are saying that because I went through my credit card company, I can't get a refund.  Buyers beware when renting through Priceline and Ace Rent-A-Car."
Bianca Pichardo,2025-12-11T20:54:48.000Z,Matt was super helpful! It is our first time in Denver so he was super patient and informative walking us through the best options for snow days. 5/5 and would certainly recommend!

Christoph Pfeiffer,2025-12-03T17:10:01.000Z,"I rented a car in Warsaw through ACE Rent A Car, operated locally by OSEK Rent A Car. After returning the vehicle, I was unexpectedly charged for an alleged windshield damage – without any valid or verifiable proof.Here is exactly what happened:There were no clear, dated photos of the windshield at pickup, so the company cannot prove the car was undamaged before the rental.The so-called “damage photos” taken at return were made in the dark, without context, and do not show any identifiable damage.The company did not provide an official workshop invoice, only a self-generated “estimate” for 5,320 PLN.I immediately disputed the claim because no evidence supports it, and the burden of proof lies with the rental company.A VISA chargeback and formal complaints with European and Polish consumer authorities have already been initiated.After reading the reviews here and on Google, it is clear that this is not an isolated incident. Many customers report the same pattern: unjustified post-rental charges and questionable damage claims.Conclusion:I strongly advise against renting from ACE / OSEK in Warsaw. Their handling of damage claims is opaque, unprofessional, and appears to follow a recurring pattern. There are many reputable rental companies in Warsaw – unfortunately, this is not one of them."
Mr Gavin Mayhew,2025-12-03T13:51:46.000Z,"Terrible experience with ACE Florence, Italy - they took an Euro 1800 deposit if you don’t go with their overpriced and endless added insurance covers and then sit on it for 30 working days which in the real world is about 40 days. Totally unnecessary and means you have to pay the credit card bill just to have it refunded 5-10 days later. Frankly - just a con to sit on the money. Really rude, aggressive and unhelpful lady at the desk also"
Kayleigh G.,2025-12-02T20:44:12.000Z,"Matt was super friendly and accommodating, despite technical difficulties that were outside of his control! Give that man a raise!!!!"
Andrew Phillips,2025-12-02T18:20:22.000Z,Dhiren was a huge help. He gave me a car that would help with the upcoming snowstorm. Great experience!
